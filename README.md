Plan
----

One button top-down battle racer for as many players as feasible - at least 8 on a keyboard, 6 on a tablet and 4 on a phone.

Spalg-style controls
+ With no interaction, car turns left or right and accelerates
 + Constant radial turn per time but increasing speed, so arc starts tight and gets wider
+ Each click (release) flips the direction of turn AND brakes
+ Long click triggers weapon/powerup (on release)

Physics
-------

+ Linear and angular velocity?
+ Collisions

Graphics
--------

+ Title page incorporating instructions

Sound
-----

+ Music
+ Basic sounds
